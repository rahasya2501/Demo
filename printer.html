<h3>Types of Printers:</h3>
<ol>
 <li>Ink jet Sprays ink at a sheet of paper. Ink-jet printers produce high-quality text and graphics.</li>
   <li>laser: Uses the same technology as copy machines. Laser printers produce very high quality text and graphics.</li>
   <li>LED: Similar to a laser printer but uses light-emitting diodes rather than a laser to produce an image on the drum.</li>  
   <li>thermal printer: Works by pushing heated pins against heat-sensitive paper. Thermal printers are widely used in calculators, ATMs and cash registers.
dye-sublimation: Uses heat to transfer dye to paper, fabric, plastic cards or other media. These printers are often used to print photos or ID cards.</li>

<h3>Types of Mouses</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mechanical mouse: Houses a hard rubber ball that rolls as the mouse is moved. Sensors inside the mouse body detect the movement and translate it into information that the computer interprets.</li>

<li>Optical mouse: Uses an LED sensor to detect tabletop movement and then sends off that information to the computer</li>

<li>Infrared (IR) or radio frequency cordless mouse: With both these types, the mouse relays a signal to a base station wired to the computer’s mouse port. The cordless mouse requires power, which comes in the form of batteries.</li>

<li>A mouse with many buttons: The extra buttons can be programmed to do specific things, such as navigate the Web or turn pages when you’re reading a document. The typical button-ified mouse has about five buttons.</li>

<li>Trackball mouse: Like an upside-down mouse. Rather than roll the mouse around, you use your thumb or index finger to roll a ball on top of the mouse. The whole contraption stays stationary, so it doesn’t need a lot of room, and its cord never gets tangled.</li>

<li>Stylus mouse: Another mouse mutation enjoyed by the artistic type is the stylus mouse, which looks like a pen and draws on a special pad.

Cordless 3-D mouse: This kind of mouse can be pointed at the computer screen like a TV remote.</li>
