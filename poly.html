<h3>Polynomial</h3>
In mathematics, a polynomial is an expression consisting of variables and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents of variables.Polynomials appear in many areas of mathematics and science. For example, they are used to form polynomial equations, which encode a wide range of problems, from elementary word problems to complicated problems in the sciences; they are used to define polynomial.
in general,<u><b>
a<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub>+b<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>+c<sub>1</sub>x<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup>+ -------- +a<sub>n</sub>x<sub>n</sub><sup>n</sup> </u></b>
and when it is equalto zero this becomes an algebraic equation.<u><b>
a<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub>+b<sub>1</sub>x<sub>2</sub>+c<sub>1</sub>x<sub>3</sub>=0</u></b></br>
for eg.
x<sup>3</sup>+3x<sup>2</sup>+9x-13=0
